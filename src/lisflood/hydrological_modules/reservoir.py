class Reservoir(HydroModule):
    """
    The reservoir module simulates the behaviour of reservoirs within a hydrological model using
    the routine developed by Hanazaki et al. (2022).

    This module handles the initialization and dynamic simulation of reservoirs, accounting for
    inflow, outflow, and storage capacity. It includes functionality to model the effects of
    reservoirs on the flow regime, such as storage changes and flow regulation based on
    predefined operational rules.

    Attributes:
    -----------
        var (object): An object containing all the variables used within the reservoir module.

    Methods:
    --------
        initial(): Sets up the initial conditions and parameters for the reservoir simulation,
                   including reservoir locations, storage capacities, limits, and initial storage.
        dynamic_inloop(NoRoutingExecuted: int): Performs dynamic calculations within the routing
                   loop to simulate inflow, storage, and controlled outflow from the reservoirs.
